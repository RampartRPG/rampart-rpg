Currently, I'm trying to figure out how exactly to structure the rulebook for the game. Like the order in which we teach the game, we can start with either explaining basic game rules first or by explaining how to make characters first, which do you prefer?

If you pick the first option we should write about things like leveling and how it works, stress, the basic skills like MGT WIL etc. that we went over

If you pick the second, well I'm not sure what we'd write about exactly since there are no classes but we could give players a quick guide on how to create their first character.

Combat, equipment etc. can come much later so let's just write the first chapter for now. 
Thoughts?
