Currently, I'm trying to figure out how exactly to structure the rulebook for the game. Like the order in which we teach the game, we can start with either explaining basic game rules first or by explaining how to make characters first, which do you prefer?
# Let's examine some core rulebooks but I think most of them start off with character creation but that seems kind of counterproductive. You can't really create a character without knowing the rules.
# I think it makes sense to list out the basics of play, rolling dice, creating characters interacting with the game world. Then have a section about character creation which leads to another section about the detailed rules
# such as stress, magic, the variety of combat rules, crafting, exploring etc.

If you pick the first option we should write about things like leveling and how it works, stress, the basic skills like MGT WIL etc. that we went over

If you pick the second, well I'm not sure what we'd write about exactly since there are no classes but we could give players a quick guide on how to create their first character.

Combat, equipment etc. can come much later so let's just write the first chapter for now. 
Thoughts?

# I think a quick intro about what our aim is and how this game differs from other TTRPGs is a good start, a few pages of that and then we can move onto character creation which on its own will have quite a lot of sections.
# Stats, Race, Abilities, Skills, Background, Equipment in that order. The equipment section can naturally lead to a page about different items and weapons which will lead to combat rules.
