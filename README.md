# Introduction

  Welcome to Rampart! 
In this tabletop roleplaying game you will find a challenging yet rewarding combat experience filled with dangerous encounters and imaginative gameplay mechanics.

You are fully encouraged to customize your experience to your liking in this unrestrictive adventure as unlike most TTRPGs there isn't a clear world for Rampart, and there are no classes either. (further information on Chapter 3)

In order to fully maximize player freedom, the game offers no clear character roles and inspires players to create their own abilities.

It's a system that won't drown newcomers in an overload of information whilst keeping veterans engaged with enough complexity and variety.
