  I've been thinking about getting rid of the 6 main ability scores STR, DEX, CON, WIS, INT, CHA.

MIGHT [MGT]: Repressents physical power and is a combination of STR and CON. Serving as contributers to both melee damage and HP.
FINESSE / AGILITY [FIN/AGI]: Repressents speed, quick hand movements and percision, standin for DEX. It helps with Initiative, Ranged attacks, and finesse weapons.
WILL [WIL]: Repressents reesolve, intelligence and perception. A combination of WIS and INT. It will probably have many types of skill checks and obviously help with stress and some saving throws.
PRESENCE [PRS]: Repressents social skills, manipulation, intimidation and bartering. Standin for CHA. It helps with social situations which come up for often than any other skill check.

  Derived Stats

HP = 8 + MIGHT at 1st level, gain 2d6 or the AVG 7 + MIGHT on every level up.

STRESS = 4 + WILL + LV.

SPEED = 25ft + AGILITY * 5ft.

AC = Armor + FINESSE with the Armor's FINESSE CAP in mind.
