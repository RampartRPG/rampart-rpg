# I've been thinking about getting rid of the 6 main ability scores STR, DEX, CON, WIS, INT, CHA.

As is, leaving INT and WIS as separate stats doesn't really accomplish much as we don't have classes and thus casting spells / "abilities" doesn't have to be tied with INT or WIS you can just pick and choose.
In these secnarios CHA clearly becomes the superior stat is its helpful for social situations. WIS and INT are still "good enough" on their own especially WIS with its contribution to the STRESS system.

I have 2 different stat systems to match this disperancy and differentiate RampartRPG from D&D 5e and Pathfinder 2e.

# 1) 4 Core Stats:

MIGHT [MGT]: Repressents physical power and is a combination of STR and CON. Serving as contributers to both melee damage and HP.
FINESSE / AGILITY [FIN/AGI]: Repressents speed, quick hand movements and percision, standin for DEX. It helps with Initiative, Ranged attacks, and finesse weapons.
WILL [WIL]: Repressents reesolve, intelligence and perception. A combination of WIS and INT. It will probably have many types of skill checks and obviously help with stress and some saving throws.
PRESENCE [PRS]: Repressents social skills, manipulation, intimidation and bartering. Standin for CHA. It helps with social situations which come up for often than any other skill check.

This solves the magic problem by eliminating unnecessary baggage, Also in this system PRS can't be used as the magic stat with WIL as the clear magic stat.

##really good idea as the magic system in dnd is insanely weird and pretty op without many downsides (esp. cha casters)

# 2) 5 Core Stats:

POWER: Repressents physical strength and brute force. Standin for STR. 
FINESSE / AGILITY: Repressents speed, quick hand movements and percision, standin for DEX.
ENDURANCE: Repressents health, physical fitness and sheer bulk. Standin for CON.
WILL: Repressents reesolve, intelligence and perception. A combination of WIS and INT.
PRESENCE: Repressents social skills, manipulation, intimidation and bartering. Standin for CHA.

This system is much of the same but it separates MGT into POW and END, I'm not too sure if this is good or not as martial characters (there is no martial / caster split here as there are no classes but character themes remain) might need power and endurance
to be a single stat if they want to be viable against caster characters. The ability system lends itself to giving casters an edge as the cost of spells is entirely dictated by players and the GM. 

##con being separated or not is a tough call. for now i think i'll go with the 1st option but lets talk more in detail in vc. and depending on the option we pick here i think we'll need to change the lvling system accordingly.

I'd like to hear your thoughts.
