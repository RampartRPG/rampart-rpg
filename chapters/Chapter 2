Chapter 2,
>Combat Rules

# Introduction to Combat

RampartRPG can be broadly split into 2 styles of play both of which are observed regularly in most games: Exploration and Combat. 
When characters enter Combat the game's rules tighten and characters cannot move freely and take actions as they please. They are bound by an action economy which operates in turns.
In combat movement is also precisely measured by grids and each character can only move up to a certain amount of tiles within a single turn.
This stricter ruleset allows for battles to be more strategic and tactical.
&& I wanted to explain the gameplay of exploration in either chapter 1 or 0 but im not sure where to exactly put it, thoughts?

# Initiative

The game switches from Exploration mode to Combat Mode through the use of an Initiatve Roll. Initiative is used to determine who goes first in combat and how the turns will play out.
If a party was attacked without their knowledge such as a surprise attack instead of an Initiative Roll the attacking side goes first.
When an actively hostile group notices the players or someone attacks another group. The GM asks for the character with the highest PRESENCE on either side to roll a Presence Attribute Check.
This is called an Initiative Roll. The side which rolled higher has their turn first. The side with the higher roll decides among themselves who is going to be first.
The character picked finishes their turn and picks another member on their side to continue. This continues onwards until all the characters on one side have finished their turns.
This order isn't fixed in place and every round they can act in whichever order they please according to these rules.

# Action Economy

One turn is 12 seconds of in-game time and during a turn each character has three action slots each roughly taking 3-4 seconds of time.
These slots are used to perform actions which can range from very simple (Moving, Attack, Interacting) to very complex (Battle Manevuers, Casting Spells, Battle Actions). 
Each action takes a certain amount of action slots to perform with the minimum being 1 and maximum being 3.
Doing almost anything during combat spends some amount of action slots so there are no free actions, bonus actions, or reactions.
The time it takes for all members of all parties to finish their turns is called a Round. You can also measure a round as the time it took for you to get your turn again after playing.
The length of rounds can range anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes of ingame time.

# Actions in Combat

Most acts players can think of have been added into the game in some form as an Action in Combat. These actions can be classified into two categories: Simple and Complex Actions.
The definition of these categories is rather loose but it's mostly based on feel and mechanical complexity. More often than not complex actions will involve an attribute check.

> Simple Actions include: Attacking, Moving, Interacting, Casting a Spell etc.
> Complex Actions include: Performing Maneuvers, Dashing, Grappling, Feinting an Attack, Aiming etc.

A complete list of actions can be found at the end of this segment, it is highly advised that players familiarize themselves with all of them and if necessary carry around
a piece of paper with the descriptions of each action present on them. The better a player knows the actions they can take the more powerful their character usually ends up being.

# Movement and Grids

In combat moving around doesn't happen in a carefree way unlike in exploration mode. When a character's turn comes they have to use the Move action to move around a gridded map.
A character can move up to their SPEED in a single turn. (SPEED = 25 + 5ft * AGI modifier)
Each tile in the gridded battlemap represents 5ft of space so a character with 30ft of SPEED can move up to 6 tiles in their turn.
A character doesn't have to move their entire speed in a single move action and they can take multiple move actions in a single turn but during this turn they can only move up to their SPEED.
There are other Actions which let a character move such as: Dash and Disengage and they can be found in the list of actions at the end of this segment.

# Armors and Armor Class

Armor Class or AC represents how hard a target is to hit. The higher the AC, the harder it is to damage the target.
AC represents both how agile a character is and how hard their armor is, agile foes are harder to hit, while heavier armors tend to absorb hits more.
AC is calculated as: AC = 10 + Armor Bonus + AGI Bonus up to the AGI Cap of the armor. Every character has an AC and thus every character can be hit!
There are many ways to increase your AC during combat such as equipping a weapon with the Defensive tag, taking cover behind an object or using the defend action.
Armor contributes the most to AC so do not skip out on gearing up! A complete list of armors can be found at the end of this segment.

# Attack Rolls

In combat, the most basic and common thing that happens is players making attack rolls with melee or ranged weapons (an attack role is calculated as d20 + MGT or AGI) against a target's AC (Armor Class). This uses 1 of your Action Slots in combat.
Attack Rolls are your likelihood of hitting your enemy properly and if you've dealt damage to them.
These rolls can have these results:

> Critical Failure: Happens when you roll a 1 on your d20 or roll 10 points below the target's AC. Your attack misses and your target gets an Attack of Opportunity against you.
> Failure: Happens when you roll under the target's AC. Your attack misses.
> Glancing Hit: Happens when you roll 1 or 2 points below the target's AC. Your attack partially hits and you roll for damage but the result is halved.
> Success: Happens when you roll above or equal to the target's AC. Your attack hits and you roll for damage.
> Critical Success: Happens when you roll a 20 on your d20 or roll 10 points above the target's AC. Your attack hits, you roll for damage and you can choose to either deal double damage or apply the bleeding condition.

Multiple Attack Penalty or MAP for short is a mechanic to stop characters from using 3 attacks every turn and force them to be creative and use more of their toolsets.
When a character attacks in their turn and decides to attack again in the same turn they receive a -3 to their second attack roll, and if they decide to attack once again for a third time they receive a -7 to their attack roll.
So, players can still attack multiple times but they aren't encouraged to do so.

# Damage Rolls and Weapons

Damage measures how much harm you've done to your target and its subtracted from their HP. There aren't different damage types in RampartRPG all damage is flat.
The amount of damage your attack deals is a combination of your weapon's dice and your character's attributes. Each weapon has a set of dice called "Damage Dice" attached to them indicating which dice you use to deal damage with said weapon.
They can be a variety of dice such as 1d4/1d12/2d6/3d4. These make the backbone of your damage and your character's MIGHT or AGILITY act more like additions to it.
The damage of melee weapons are calculated as the weapon's Damage Dice + the MIGHT modifier of the character using it.
The damage of ranged weapons are calculated as the weapon's Damage Dice + the AGILITY modifier of the character using it.
Melee weapons with the Finesse tag can be used with AGILITY modifier if the character using it prefers that, these weapons usually use dexterity and quick movements more than brute strength.

The dice aren't the only thing which defines a weapon. Each weapon has a unique set of tags attached to them which alter how it differs from other weapons and every weapon also has a unique Maneuver attached to it.
Maneuvers are highly useful special techniques which give the weapons identity. An explanation of each weapon's Manuver can be found in the list of weapons at the end of this segment.

# Weapon Handling

Each player character has two hands unless stated otherwise, so they can have up to two weapons equipped at any given them.
In most combat scenarios it is expected that the party doesn't have their weapons equipped unless they were preparing for combat or had stated that they drew their weapons before the start of combat.
During combat, drawing a regular weapon costs only a single action under the *Interact* action. This act lets you draw one weapon, if this weapon is single-handed then by default you draw it with only one hand.
If its two-handed then by default you draw it with two, but for versatile weapons you can choose if you want to use it with one or two hands.
If you want to switch between single-handed and two-handed modes on a versatile weapon that also takes a single *Interact* action.

Stowing a weapon back into its sheath or your backpack also takes one *Interact* action. All the rules stated in drawing apply to stowing as well. 
Dropping a weapon, throwing it to an ally or handing it to an ally costs one *Interact* action also. But throwing requires a successful AGI check with DC varying based on distance and the situation.
If a player has two weapons equipped they can use either one completely independent from the other one.

Some weapon tags have special cases for weapon handling:
> Heavy: Weapons with the heavy tag require 2 actions to draw and stow. They also requires 13+ MGT to use without a -2 penalty to all Attack Rolls.
> Light: Weapons with the light tag can drawn or stowed once per round for free. They also lower the MAP (Multiple Attack Penalty) by changing them into -2 and -6 respectively.


# Attacks of Opportunity

Attacks of Opportunity are a special type of attack performed outside of the usual turn order. They require a trigger to occur and can only be used right after said trigger.
When another character provokes a trigger, your character can perform an Attack of Opportunity against them with a regular attack and damage roll. These triggers include:
> Trying to move outside of a character's melee range without using the disengage action. -------------
> Critically failing an attack roll against a character.
> Attacking a character with a ranged weapon while within their melee range.

A character can't use more than one Attack of Opportunity in a single round.

# Flanking and Cover

Flanking an enemy is a tactic which is rather useful in battle, if two characters on the same side surround an opposing character by standing at opposite sides of them this action is called flanking.
Characters which are flanking the target gain a +2 to the attack rolls they make against the flanked target.

Cover is a way to hide from danger, characters can hide behind objects or other characters during combat giving a -2 to attack rolls made against them.

# Health and Death

Every character has a stat called Hit Points or HP which measures how many hits they can take during combat. Characters with higher HPs can stay in battle for far longer than characters with low HPs.
To calculate HP on a Level 1 character, follow this formula: Maximum HP = 2d6 + MGT modifier at first level. Upon leveling up, your HP increases by 2d6 + current MGT modifier.
Whenever a character receives some sort of damage they subtract that from their HP and write it out as Current HP / Maximum HP.

There are a few ways to regain lost HP such as: Potions, Spells, First Aid, Medical Kits and the most common way: Resting.
Resting replenishes HP based on the quality and length of rest which can be classified into 2 categories:
> Half-Rest: Length of	30 Minutes to 2 Hours in non-ideal conditions: Regain 2d6 + MGT modifier HP.
> Full-Rest: Length of	6 - 10 Hours in ideal conditions (such as sleeping in a bed): Regain Maximum HP.

When a character's HP is reduced to 0, they become Incapacitated and gain the Dying and Unconscious conditions.
The Unconscious condition makes it so that the character can not take any actions during their turn and are functionally out of the picture.
The Dying condition however lets the character take one specific action during their turn bypassing the Unconscious condition, that being the Resist Death action.

The Resist Death takes three action slots and makes the character roll a MGT Attribute Check with DC10. Upon a:
> Critical Success: The character loses both the Dying and Unconscious conditions and gets up with 1 HP.
> Success: The character loses the Dying condition but remains Unconscious until they rest or are healed by other means. All death markers are erased as well.
> Failure: The character gains one Death Marker and the conditions remain as they are.
> Critical Failure: The character gains two Death Markers and the conditions remain as they are.

Death Markers measure how close a character is to death.
When the amount of Death markers a character has reaches 2 they gain a scar.
When the amount of Death Markers a character has reaches 3 they breathe their final breath and their life ends.
There are various ways to bring back characters from the dead but they are mostly left to the GM's choice.

# Stress
Stress is one of the core mechanics of Rampart and it measures the physical and mental strain being put on your character.
Your Stress Threshold (ST), which is your character's capacity of enduring stress can be calculated with this formula: ST = 4 + WIL modifier + LV.

Many things you encounter within the game may cause your characters to obtain points of Stress and having too many points of Stress will cause your characters to gain Trauma.
 Here are some examples of situations that your characters may find to be stressful:
  > Using magical abilities
  > Getting afflicted with conditions like fear, horror or mind control.
  > Enduring traumatic or exhausting events.
  > Taking damage greater than or equal to your MAX HP.

There are many ways of reducing stress such as: Abilities, Spells, Potions and the most common way: Resting.
The amount of Stress reduced by resting depends on the type of Rest:
  
> Half-Rest: Length of	30 Minutes to 2 Hours in less than ideal conditions: Remove 1d4 Stress Points.
> Full-Rest: Length of	6 - 10 Hours in a bed or similar: Remove all Stress Points.

 If you fail to reduce your Stress points and surpass the Stress threshold of your character, roll a WIL Attribute Check with a DC (Difficulty Level) of 15, follow these rules based on the result of the dice:
> Critical Success: Reduce your stress by 3 points.
> Success: Reduce your stress by 1 point.
> Failure: Gain a Trauma and your stress is reduced to 0.
> Critical Failure: Gain a Trauma, your stress is reduced to 0 and your character becomes unplayable for your next turn.i

# Wounds (Scars and Trauma)
  Wounds represent permanent impairments that your character receives on special occasions. There are two types of wounds representing physical and mental wounds. These are:

> Scars, which are brutal reminders for heroes who have walked too close to death. They represent physical wounds from past conflicts.
> And Traumas, whcih are psychological conditions of those who reached their limits. They represent mental wounds from past conflicts.

 The two main ways of receiving scars are:
> Getting hit with Massive Damage (Damage higher or equal to your Maximum HP).
> Reaching 2 Death Markers.
When either of these things happen, the character can either pick an appropriate scar from the scar table or roll for it. The scar will stay with them until they can heal it at higher levels.
Reaching levels 5th and 10th allows a player to remove one scar from their character.

The only way to obtain a trauma is:
 Failing or critically failing the WIL Attribute check made after reaching above your Stress Threshold.
  
Losing Wounds requires a character to reach Level 5 or 10 where they are allowed to remove one wound from their characters.

# Conditions

Conditions are a special type of effect applied to characters or weapons for a duration of time during combat.
There are several ways of obtaining conditions and each condition provides a unique set of buffs or nerfs a complete list of conditions can be found at the end of this segment.

All character conditions by default last for 3 turns unless stated otherwise. 
In order to lose a condition earlier than that characters have to use the Recover action:
> Recover (2 Action Slots): You try to pull yourself together in order to lose one physical or mental condition. The recover action will involve different saving throws
depending on the type of condition you're trying to lose.
> Physical Conditions: Roll a DC10 MGT save and on a success get rid of the condition.
> Mental Conditions: Roll a DC10 WIL save and on a success get rid of the condition.

Weapon conditions by default do not have a time limit, they retain the condition until a character does something to remove it.
> Fixing Broken Weapons: Requires the use of a *Smith's Tools* *Tinkering Kit* or a substitute item, and a successful roll with a DC10.
Smithing, Crafting, Tinkering or another appropiate skill check. This takes 1 action during combat.
Alternatively a Blacksmith or another professional can remove the condition for the cost of half the weapon's worth.

> Fixing Destroyed Weapons: Requires the use of a *Smith's Tools* *Tinkering Kit* or a substitute item, and a successful roll with a DC15.
Smithing, Crafting, Tinkering or another appropiate skill check. This takes 2 actions during combat.
Alternatively a Blacksmith or another professional can remove the condition for the cost of 3/4s the weapon's worth.

> Losing the Sharpened Condition: The sharpened condition is lost after a character misses an attack roll with this weapon.
