Introduction

Welcome to Rampart! In this tabletop roleplaying game you will find a challenging yet rewarding combat experience. 
It's a system that won't drown newcomers in an overload of information whilst keeping veterans engaged with enough complexity and variety.
  

  What You'll Need:
A set of dice for tabletop games (Rolling dice can be done digitally.), this game will most frequently require a D20 like a lot of other TTRPGs as it's used to accomplish just about any action that would pose any challenge
  however other dices will also be required for various tasks like calculating damage dealt etc.
A group of 3-5 people, this is the ideal number for Rampart and the game was designed with this type of group in mind, if you wish to play with any other number of people you may adjust the rules to better fit your party.
Having a printed character sheet will be useful as noting down certain things can make things easier.
Gridded battle maps will also make the experience better as it will be much easier to visualize combat this way.

In case this is your first time playing a TTRPG here are some basics to get you started.
  
In TTRPGs there are two roles, these being the players and the GM (game master)
