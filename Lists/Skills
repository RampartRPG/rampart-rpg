Skills

A skill is a task or topic which your character is extraordinarily good at, they have a wide range of uses
but the most important ones are [Skill Check]s. Every skill is inherently tied to an Attribute.
When a character attempts to do something if the task at hand is particularly hard the GM will ask for an [Skill Check].

Example:
-Character A attempts to craft a (Potion of Moderate Healing).
-The GM asks for a [WIL] [Skill Check] with a DC15. The DC is left to GM interpretations.
-The character rolls a D20 adds their [WIL] modifier and adds the bonus they obtained from a skill if its relavent such as (Alchemy) or (Crafting)
-The roll of the dice tells them their degree of success or failure which is again up to GM interpretation.

Every character by default starts with 3 trained skills, and they gain or upgrade a skill at levels 4 and 8.
These skills can be chosen from the list below or made up by the player and GM. The GM has to make sure that the skill isn't too specific or broad.
Your skills can be at 4 distinct tiers each giving a different amount of bonus to your [Skill Check]s, when a character doesn't specifically have anything to do with a skill its untrained by default:

Untrained: +0
Trained:   +2
Skilled:  +4
Mastered:  +6
