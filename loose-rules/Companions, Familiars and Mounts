Companions are creatures which are bound to a character and won't act without their input.
Magical Companions are referred to as Familiars, and Companions which can be rode are referred to as Mounts.

A character has as many Companion Slots as their PRESENCE modifier. Every companion takes some amount of Slots. A character with negative or 0 PRESENCE modifier can't have any companions.
Some companions may need a character to meet or exceed a PRESENCE requirement, this is usually reserved for more powerful ones.


Companions act during their owner's turn and only when they are commanded via the Command (1) action. This action allows for one companion within range to execute to 2 action slots' worth of actions.
Companions are still bound by the 3 action economy so using a second Command action only allows for 1 action slot's worth of actions.
Companions can only use Companion acts and any additional acts listed under them.
