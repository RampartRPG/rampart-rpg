# Stress and Trauma

Stress measures the physical and mental strain put on your character. Your Stress Threshold ST which is your character's capacity of enduring stress, its calculated as:
ST = 4 + WIL + LV.

When your character encounters stressful situations they gain some amount of stress. Some examples of stress situations are:

# Using magical or unstable abilities.
# Failing a save against fear, horror, or mind control.
# Enduring traumatic or exhausting events.
# Taking damage greater than or equal to your MAX HP.

There are several ways of reducing your stress which are:

# Resting in unsafe inadequate conditions removes 2 points of stress.
# Resting in safe enviroment reduces your stress to 0.
# Calming activities and spells may reduce few points of stress.

When your stress reaches your Stress Threshold you have to make a Trauma Saving Throw, Roll a DC15 WIL save and on a:

# Critical Success: Reduce your stress by 3 points.
# Success: Reduce your stress by 1 point.
# Failure: Gain a Trauma and your stress is reduced to 0.
# Critical Failure: Gain a Trauma, your stress is reduced to 0 and your character becomes unplayable for your next turn.

Traumas repressent semi-permanent mental scars serving as nerfs which you'll character have to either outgrow or embrace at later levels.
// I'll add a list of traumas later on depending on types.
If your character accumilates 3 traumas and on their next failed trauma saving throw their character mentally breaks and becomes unplayable either having to retire from adventuring or become an NPC.

Healing a trauma requires your character to level up to level 5 at which point they gain the ability to either remove one trauma or scare or "evolve" them.
// More on evolution later on.
