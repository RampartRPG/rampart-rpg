Weapon Handling

In most TTRPGs the aspect of "weapon handling" is mostly unaccounted for and even where there are rules for it most tables tend to ignore it.
To fix that I've made a tight and fast list of rules which are accessible and advised to be used in all combat scenarios.

Each player character has two hands unless explicitly stated otherwise, so they can have upto two weapons equiped at any given them.
In most combat scenarios it is expected that the party doesn't have their weapons equiped unless they were preparing for combat or had stated that they drew their weapons before the start of combat.
During combat, drawing a regular weapon costs only a signle action under the *Interact* action. This act lets you draw one weapon, if this weapon is single-handed then by default you draw it with only one hand.
If its dual-handed then by default you draw it with two, but for versatile weapons you can choose if you want to use it with one or two hands.
If you want to switch between single-handed and dual-handed modes on a versatile weapon that also takes a single *Interact* action.

Stowing a weapon back into its sheat or your backpack also takes one *Interact* action. All the rules stated in drawing apply to stowing as well. 
Dropping a weapon, throwing it to an ally or handing it to an ally costs one *Interact* action also. But throwing requires a successful FIN check with DC varying from situation to situation.
This creates the necessary situation where switching weapons always takes two actions no matter how you do the switching.
If a player has two weapons equiped they can use either one completely independent from the other one.

For all of the rules stated above shields also count as weapons.

These rules make it so that the first round of combat almost always starts with the characters drawing their weapons which adds a layer of realism and excitement to combat. Its cool to see
your characters ready themselves for combat before just attacking the same enemy for a bunch of turns.

Some weapon tags have special cases for weapon handling these include:

# Heavy: Weapons with the heavy tag require 2 actions to draw and stow. They also requires 13+ MGT to use without a -2 to penalty to all attack roles.
# Light: Weapons with the light tag can drawn or stowed once per round for free. They also lower the *MAP* by 1 making them -3 and -7 respectively.

MAP is the multiple attack penalty which lowers your attack roll by -4 on your second attack in a round and by -8 on a third roll.
