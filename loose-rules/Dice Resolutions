RamprtRPG uses the default D20 system to determine the success or failure of an action in our outside of combat. Whenever a character attempts to do something
deemed non-trivial; acts which have a component of luck they have to roll against a number referred to as a DC (Difficulty Class) to determine the outcome.

There are all kinds of rolls but most common are: Attribute Checks and Skill Checks and they both use the D20. 
Attribute Checks are raw tests of power: You roll a d20 + Relavent Attribute Modifier and compare it to a DC.
Skill Checks are tests of finer work: You roll a d20 + Relavent Attribute Modifier + Relavent Skill Modifier and compare it to a DC.
Players can attempt to turn Attribute Checks into Skill Checks if the skill in question is conceivably a part of the act the character is attempting.

Each roll has a certain degree of success to it put into 4 categories:
Critical Failure: Happens when you roll a 1 on your d20 or roll 10 points below the target DC. It means that you have disastrously failed at your attempt and will suffer consequences.
Failure: Happens when you roll under the target DC. It means that you have failed at your attempt.
Success: Happens when you roll above or at the target DC. It means you have succeeded at your attempt.
Critical Success: Happens when you roll a 20 on your d20 or roll 10 points above the target AC. It means that you have exceptionally succeeded at your attempt and will gain benefits.
