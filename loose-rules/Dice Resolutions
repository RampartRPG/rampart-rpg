RamprtRPG uses the default D20 system to determine the success or failure of an action in our outside of combat. Whenever a character attempts to do something
deemed non-trivial; acts which have a component of luck they have to roll against a number referred to as a DC (Difficulty Class) to determine the outcome.

There are all kinds of rolls but most common are: Attribute Checks, Skill Checks or Attack Rolls and they all use the D20. 
Attribute Checks are raw tests of power: You roll a d20 + Relavent Attribute Modifier and compare it to a DC.
Skill Checks are tests of finer work: You roll a d20 + Relavent Attribute Modifier + Relavent Skill Modifier and compare it to a DC.
Players can attempt to turn Attribute Checks into Skill Checks if the skill in question is conceivably a part of the act the character is attempting.
Attack Rolls are unique in that they only happen during combat, they measure how successful you were at hitting your target. d20 + MGT/AGI Modifier depending on weapon and compare it to target AC.

Each roll has a certain degree of success to it put into 4 categories:
Critical Failure: Happens when you roll a 1 on your d20 or roll 10 points below the target DC. It means that you have disastrously failed at your attempt and will suffer consequences.
Failure: Happens when you roll under the target DC. It means that you have failed at your attempt.
Success: Happens when you roll above or at the target DC. It means you have succeeded at your attempt.
Critical Success: Happens when you roll a 20 on your d20 or roll 10 points above the target AC. It means that you have exceptionally succeeded at your attempt and will gain benefits.

Attack Rolls are unique in that they have a condition of partial success as well called a Glancing Hit:
Glancing Hit: Happens when you roll 1 or 2 points below the target AC, It means that you have managed to hit your target but have to halve your damage.
