Glancing Hits and Critical Reversal

In combat, the most basic and common thing that happens is player's making attack rolls with melee or ranged weapons (an attack role is calculated as d20 + MGT or FIN) against a target's AC (Armor Class).
These rolls can either result in a CRIT FAIL, FAIL, SUCCESS, CRIT SUCCESS just like any other roll:

# Critical Fail: You miss your attack and your target gets to make a Critical Reversal attack on you.
# Fail: You miss your attack.
# Success: You succeed in your attack and roll for damage. Which is calculated as Weapon Dice + MGT or FIN.
# Critical Success: You succeed in your attack and roll for damage as usual but you get to choose either doubling that damage or applying the bleeding condition to the enemy.

Glancing hits and Critical Reversals are special cases to this format. 

If the Attack Roll missed the target's AC within 2 points. Instead of failing they get a "partial success" called a Glancing Hit:
# Glancing Hit: You partially succeed in your attack and roll for damage but you have to halve it.

// This prevents fights with High AC enemies from becoming boring, repetitive and sluggish. Sometimes barely missing a shot feels devastating but here it feels dramatic.
// This might help us make combat more creative, with certain weapon tags or actions letting you get full damage on a Glancing Hit or increase the chance of a glancing hit happening by making it 3 points instead of 2.
// Missing an attack never feels good and it has little effect on the narrative of the game so I feel this is a good addition.

When an attacker misses their attack with a critical failure, the target gains the ability to perform a Critical Reversal.
# Critical Reversal: Target makes one regular attack towards the attacker even though its not their turn yet.
