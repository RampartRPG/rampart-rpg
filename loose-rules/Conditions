# Sharpened: Sharpened weapons gain a +1 to their attack rolls. (Only usable on melee weapons which can feasibly be sharpened.)

How to gain weapon conditions:
# Gaining Broken: Your weapon can break from a variety of attacks inflicted on it from enemies and also from making a *power strike*.
# Gaining Destroyed: Your weapon can be destroyed only if its already broken and receives an attack which attempts to break your weapon or you make a *power strike* with it.
# Gaining Sharpened: You can sharpen a weapon with the use of a *Whetsone*, *Sharpening Kit*, *Grindstone* or a subsitute item,
and a successful DC10 Smithing, Crafting, Tinkering or another appropiate skill check. This takes 1 action during combat.

Weapon conditions by default do not have a time limit, they retain the condition until a character does something to remove it.
# Fixing Broken Weapons: Requires the use of a *Smith's Tools* *Tinkering Kit* or a subsitute item, and a successful DC10
Smithing, Crafting, Tinkering or another appropiate skill check. This takes 1 action during combat.
