In RampartRPG the core of character creation is the ability system. Each player gets to pick from a list or create their own abilities, this allows for the system to be classless yet still have meaningful
differences between characters. It also allows for immense player freedom unlike most systems.

These abilities can be grouped into three types:
# Physical: Physical abilities are any ability which makes no use of anything other than your own body.
# Utility: Utility abilities are abilities which don't fit into the magical or physical category.
# Magical: Magical abilities are directly tied to supernatural powers and the arcane.

There is a clear mechanical difference between the design of Physical / Utility abilities and Magical abilities that being:
# Magical abilities need to have a stress cost attached to them.
# Magical abilities have a chance of inflicting stress if used without magical conduits.
# Magical abilities are strictly tied to the WILL attribute.
# Magical abilities use the Cast action.

Any character can create or pick a magical ability but they'll be upheld to these rules. For example a character which broadly feels like a brawler can pick up a magical ability but they'll still have a
chance to gain stress from it if they use it without a magical conduit.
Any player created Ability with the Magical tag has to adhere to these four core rules as well.

Character's also have access to a unique type of ability refered to as SPELLs. Each character has access to as many SPELLs as their WIL modifier and a character can't have -1 SPELLs.
SPELLs are functionally the same as abilities with player's being able to create their own or pick from a list with the difference being that SPELLs have to have the Magical Tag.
This is done in order to give "caster" characters more abilities without bloating the system.

Through this design a purely "caster" character can start with 6 abilities 3 from their character and 3 from their WIL. And go upto 12 abilities.

  Magical Conduits

Magical Conduit are objects which can stabilize and help in the casting of magical abilities, in fact using abilities without a Magical Conduit equipped or activated will have a chance
to increase the user's stress by 1 point. Every time a character uses a magical ability without a condition they have to make a DC12 WIL save and on fail they gain 1 point of stress, on a crit fail 2 points of stress.
Each conduit is either held or activated, conduits which are held need to be equipped in a character's hands to provide their bonuses and remove the Stress chance. Conduits which are activated are worn
on a character's body like: rings, amulets, crystals etc and they require 1 action during combat to activate before this activation they provide no bonuses.

Each ability cast can only receive the bonus from a single conduit, if a character has multiple equiped or activated conduits they have to choose the one they're using before casting.
A player can only have 2 Held conduits at a time (as they have 2 hands) and 1 activated conduit if they activate another one, the former deactivates.

Each magical conduit has its own small bonus that comes with it:

# Staff (Held): Staffs can be used as weapons in addition to their status as a magical conduit: Staff	1d4/1d6	(Finesse)
# Wand (Held): Adds a +1 to your magical attack rolls.
# Tome (Held): Allows you to roll a DC12 WIL save when using magical abilities, On a success you lose a point of stress that you would've otherwise gained.
# Totem (Held): Increases the Area of spells that have the area tag by 50%.
# Instrument (Held): Allows the ally whose turn is after yours to add the number of abilities you used during your turn to the first roll they make.
# Ring (Activated): Adds a +1 to your magical damage rolls.
# Amulet (Activated): Increases the range of spells with that have the ranged tag by 50%.
# Braclet (Activated): Allows you to roll a DC12 WIL save when using magical abilities, on a success this ability costs 1 less action than it would, on a fail your turn ends.
# Charm (Activated): Increases the duration of spells that have a duration by 50% rounded down.
# Elemental Crystal (Activated): When making an attack roll you can choose to the inflict condition this crystal's element: make a DC12 WIL save and on a success apply the elemental condition on a fail do half damage.
