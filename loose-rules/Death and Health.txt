Death and Health

The max [HP] of a character is calculated via this formula: 10 + [CON] at level 1.
As they progress with each level they add: 2D6 + [CON] to their max HP.

When a character's [HP] is reduced to 0, they fall {Unconscious} and start gain the {Dying} condition.
During the {Dying} condition the only action the character can take is to (Prevent Death).
The (Prevent Death)(3) action makes the character roll a [Death Save]. [Death Save] = D20 + [CON] with DC10.

If the [Death Save] is a:
-Critical Success: The character loses both the {Dying} and {Unconscious} conditions and get up with 1 [HP].
-Success: The character loses the {Dying} condition but remains {Unconscious} until healed.
-Failure: The character gains one (Death Marker) and the conditions remain as they are.
-Critical Failure: The character gains two (Death Marker)s and the conditions remain as they are.

When the amount of (Death Marker)s a character has reaches 2 they gain a permanent debuff called a {Scar}.
(Scar)s manifest in a lot of ways and can only be healed through extensive care and long days of rest.
The exact mechanics of healing a (Scar) are left open to interpretation for the GM.
To gain a (Scar) the character rolls on a list of scars which can be found at the end of the page.

Another way of obtaining (Scar)s is to take a (Severe Hit).
A (Severe Hit) is any attack which reduces your [HP] by (3/4) * your [HP] in a single action.
When a character is takes a (Severe Hit) they have to roll a [Scar Save]. [Scar Save] = D20 + [CON] with DC12.

If the [Scar Save] is a:
-Critical Success: The character gains no scars and increases their max HP by 1. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
-Success: The character gains no scars and is considered lucky.
-Failure: The character gains a (Scar) and rolls on the list of scars.
-Critical Failure: The character gains a (Scar), rolls on the list of scars and decrease their max HP by 1.
When a character accumulates 3 Scares their character breaks physically, they either die or retire from adventuring.

When the amount of (Death Marker)s a character has reaches 3 they breathe their final breath and their life ends.
There are various ways to bring back characters from the dead but they are mostly left open to interpretation for the GM.

Replenishing [HP] can be done via various means including: Abilities, Spells, Items, Potions etc.
Every healing source has to have both a constant and a dice attached to it.

Natural rest is the most common way of replenishing [HP]. The amount and complexities are below:
-Short Rest	30 Minutes - 2 Hours → Regain 2d6 + [CON] [HP]
-Long Rest	6 - 10 Hours → Regain Regain Max [HP]. Remove 1d4 Stress points.

List of Standard Healing Potions:
-Potion of Lesser Healing	Heals 2d6 + 2 [HP]. Costs 25 GP
-Potion of Moderate Healing	Heals 4d6 + 3 [HP]. Costs 60 GP
-Potion of Greater Healing	Heals 6d6 + 4 [HP]. Costs 100 GP
-Potion of Revitalization	Heals 4d6 + 3 [HP] and reduces stress to 0. Costs 120 GP.
-Potion of Calming		Heals 1d6 + 2 [HP] and reduces stress by 2 points. 80 GP.

The (First Aid)(1) action can be taken during or out of combat to heal without spells, abilities or potions.
This action requires the character using it to have a medical kit in one of their hands. 
A medical kit can be crafted with bandages, herbs, and other appropiate items and its used up when using the (First Aid) action.
When using the (First Aid) action the character rolls a [First Aid Save]. [First Aid Save] = D20 + [WIS]/[INT] + (Appropiate Skill) with DC12.
If the [First Aid Save] is a:
-Critical Success: The target regains 2d6 + [WIS]/[INT].
-Success: The target regains 1d6 + [WIS]/[INT].
-Failure: The target regains no health.
-Critical Failure: Target gains +1 Stress from botched medicine.

When using healing sources on a character which has the {Dying} condition they will gain 1/2 of the health rolled and lose the condition.
