In RampartRPG the core of character creation is the ability system. Each player gets to pick from a list or create their own abilities, this allows for the system to be classless yet still have meaningful
differences between characters. It also allows for immense player freedom unlike most systems.

These abilities can be grouped into three types:
# Physical: Physical abilities are any ability which makes no use of anything other than your own body.
# Utility: Utility abilities are abilities which don't fit into the magical or physical category.
# Magical: Magical abilities are directly tied to supernatural powers and the arcane.

There is a clear mechanical difference between the design of Physical / Utility abilities and Magical abilities that being:
# Magical abilities need to have a stress cost attached to them.
# Magical abilities have a chance of inflicting stress if used without magical conduits.
# Magical abilities are strictly tied to the WILL attribute.
# Magical abilities use the Cast action.

Any character can create or pick a magical ability but they'll be upheld to these rules. For example a character which broadly feels like a brawler can pick up a magical ability but they'll still have a
chance to gain stress from it if they use it without a magical conduit.
Any player created Ability with the Magical tag has to adhere to these four core rules as well.

Character's also have access to a unique type of ability refered to as SPELLs. Each character has access to as many SPELLs as their WIL modifier and a character can't have -1 SPELLs.
SPELLs are functionally the same as abilities with player's being able to create their own or pick from a list with the difference being that SPELLs have to have the Magical Tag.
This is done in order to give "caster" characters more abilities without bloating the system.

Through this design a purely "caster" character can start with 6 abilities 3 from their character and 3 from their WIL. And go upto 12 abilities.
